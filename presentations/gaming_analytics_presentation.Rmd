## Battle for Wesnoth

```


- Turn-based Strategy
- Open-sourced and runs on all OS (even Linux!)
- Continuous Development and Evolution

## Game Background

- There are `r nrow(unit_data$unit_basic)` different units spread over `r nrow(player_game_statistics %>% select(faction) %>% distinct())` factions on `r nrow(game_info %>% select(map) %>% distinct())` maps


- Combat contains random elements

- 17 official campaigns, more self-made ones and plenty of lore for the fanboys

## The Data Set

- 4.5GB of JSON events
- `r nrow(two_player_games)` individual games 
- `r nrow(player_lookup)` individual players
- For analysis, only meta data was used
- Data needed a little tidying
```{r, echo=F}
data[seq(1, 6), seq(30, 35)]
```

## Questions

- Are the faction choices meaningful?
- Is the starting position meaningful?
- What are good strategies?

## Factions 

- Each Player chooses a faction
- Calculate adjusted win ratio for fair coin flips with $M$ positive outcomes

$$ z = \frac{M - <M>}{\sigma_M} = \frac{2M - N}{\sqrt{N}}   $$
- In principle hierarchical extension to leaders

# To find which faction which player used in which game
game_factions <- player_game_statistics %>% 
    select(game_id, player_id, faction)

# Map on each game

- There are rock-paper-scissor relations such as 
Loyalists > Knalgan Alliance > Undead > Loyalists


## Testing the Assumptions

- Infer the probability distribution of the base probability of each group.
- Beta distribution $$ Beta(x, \alpha, \beta) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} = x^{\alpha -1} (1-x)^{\beta - 1} $$

<center>
```{r, out.width='250px'}
knitr::include_graphics("~/wesv1/presentations/beta_distributions.png")
```
</center>

- Larger $\alpha$ and $\beta$ means narrower distributions

##
- Empirically estimate parameters for each group as $\alpha = M + 1$ and $\beta = N-M + 1$, then calculate plausible intervals


```{r, echo = F}
M_value <- 35
N_value <- 60
alpha_value <- M_value + 1
beta_value <- N_value - M_value + 1
x_axis <- seq(0,1,0.0001)
distribution <- dbeta(x_axis, alpha_value, beta_value)

p50_interval <- c(qbeta(0.25,alpha_value, beta_value), qbeta(0.75,alpha_value, beta_value))
p80_interval <-  c(qbeta(0.10,alpha_value, beta_value), qbeta(0.9,alpha_value, beta_value))
p90_interval <- c(qbeta(0.05,alpha_value, beta_value), qbeta(0.95,alpha_value, beta_value))
ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(x = x_axis, y = distribution))+
  geom_line(aes(x = p90_interval, y = 0), color = 'violet', size = 3, alpha = 0.7)+
  geom_line(aes(x = p80_interval, y = 0), color = 'blue', size = 3, alpha = 0.7)+
  geom_line(aes(x = p50_interval, y = 0), color = 'red', size = 3, alpha = 0.7)+
  scale_x_continuous('Probability', limits = c(0,1), breaks = c(0, 0.5, 1))+
  geom_point(aes(x = 0.5, y = 0), shape = 4, size = 6) +
  ggtitle(str_c('Plausible interval for ', M_value, ' wins in ', N_value, ' games'))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme( axis.line.y = element_blank(), 
         axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
         axis.title.y = element_blank(),
         axis.text.y = element_blank())

## Faction-Leader Hierarchies

- L1 feature importance suggests that factions are more impactful than leaders
- Big bands are faction combinations, sub-bands are leader combinations
<center>
```{r, echo = F, out.height='250px'}
knitr::include_graphics("~/wesv1/presentations/hierarchies.png")
```
</center>

- Leaders are not exact subset of factions

## Modeling

- Built symmetrised features for factions, leaders, and map position 
- Added retroed elo difference (strongest feature)
- Logistic Regression as good as xgboost
- Shallow trees with few interactions, but uplift due to categorical features
- AUC of 0.74 and accuracy of 70% on unseen test data
