Being able to reconcile the differences between these factions and effectively lead their people requires considerable personal merit and a deep understanding of all elves, be they warrior, mystic, or pacifist.
Many elves begin training in archery and swordsmanship from a young age, and especially promising adolescent boys of appropriate lineage are selected to study under Enchantresses who have mastered the mystic arts. Since the nature of faerie magic lends itself more to female elves than to male elves, only the most talented learn to temper the volatile way of the faerie and connect themselves to the world of the arcane. Those who prove their personal mettle in swordsmanship and sorcery must then learn to apply their newfound powers wisely, for violent conflict is something never to be taken lightly, and just because a battle can be won does not mean it should be fought in the first place.

They wander the fields of battle, guided by the fading memory of their former skill, neither knowing, nor caring what their purpose or foes might be. They are driven only by a malice born of their empty and tortured existence.

‒,‒,"goblin_knight,goblin_pillager",chaotic,17,32,wolf_rider,1,8,30,"No one is quite sure how the practice of taming and riding wolves came into being, but the advantages of it for a goblin are obvious. Goblins are smaller and much weaker than their orcish kin, and are often tasked to the most dangerous and unwanted parts of a fight. Any who can manage to win themselves a mount have a much safer, and daresay, more amusing role in combat.
Wolves, likely, could never support the weight of a man in plate, but a goblin in leather armor is a simple load to bear. Quite unlike horses, these mounts have a rather easy time traversing the mountains, though water and woods will still slow them down.",https://units.wesnoth.org/1.14/mainline/en_US/Wolf%20Rider.html,238

They typically stand taller than a horse at the shoulder, and have an appetite to match. Only a madman would willingly encounter them; but goblins, at great cost to themselves, have managed to tame and ride them.
The claws of a wolf are not generally regarded as being the more dangerous parts, but on a beast this large, they are thicker and longer than iron nails. Their riders smear a poison on the front set, not unlike that used by the orcish assassins, making a swipe from these beasts’ paws into a most deadly stroke.

"ambush,regenerates",‒,elder_wose,lawful,20,52,wose,1,4,40,"Rarely seen even by elves, the Wose is an order of creature about which little is known. The elves are the source of most of this knowledge; they know that these beings are not descended from trees, despite the similarity in form, and they know that a wose is more closely tied to the faerie world than the elves themselves, though in a different way. The motives and workings of their kind are unknown, though most subscribe to the obvious theory that woses are dedicated wardens of the natural world.
Woses are utterly unwarlike, but possess a great strength. They are, however, neither used to, nor quick at moving around.
Special Notes: In woodlands, this unit’s ambush skill renders it invisible to enemies unless it is immediately adjacent or has revealed itself by attacking. This unit regenerates, which allows it to heal as though always stationed in a village.",https://units.wesnoth.org/1.14/mainline/en_US/Wose.html,242

Tales tell of woses who resemble trees in this respect as well, towering over the creatures who walk beneath them. This is the greater part of why they are so rarely seen — standing in the slumber which they so often do, a wose of that stature appears to be nothing more than an oddly-shaped tree. Even a careless elf can sometimes be fooled.
Woses are not warriors by any means, but their great strength can easily be turned to violence, should someone manage to raise the ire of these creatures.

It was thus a shock to him, one morning, when he awoke to find nothing but a bare patch of earth where the tree once stood, as though it had been spirited away in the wee hours of the night.
Such encounters are all that is known of what are presumably the most ancient of woses.
