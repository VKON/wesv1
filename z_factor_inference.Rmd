Load libraries and data

```{r, message=F, warning=F, results="hide"}
library(caret)
library(glmnet)
library(ROCR)
library(rebus)
library(broom)
source('tidy_data.R')
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = "hide"}
load_wesnoth()
set.seed(123)
```
Let us first split the games in test and train set
```{r}
two_player_games <- two_player_games %>% filter(complete.cases(.))

idx <- createDataPartition(two_player_games$first_player_wins, p = 0.8, list = F)
train_set <- two_player_games[idx,]
test_set <- two_player_games[-idx,]

(dim(train_set))
(dim(test_set))
```

It is sensible to create all features on the train set so we can accurately judge performance on the test set. We start by estimating the faction impact because we know already that the leaders are a perturbation to the faction choice.

```{r}
game_factions <- player_game_statistics %>% 
    select(game_id, player_id, faction, leader)

aug_games <-  train_set %>% 
    left_join(game_factions, 
              by =c('game_id' = 'game_id','first_player_id'='player_id') ) %>% 
    rename(fp_faction = faction, fp_leader = leader ) %>% 
    left_join(game_factions, 
              by =c('game_id' = 'game_id','second_player_id'='player_id') ) %>% 
    rename(sp_faction = faction, sp_leader = leader)

faction_cleaned <- aug_games  %>% 
    # Order the factors alphabetically, this way more data per faction is obtained  
    mutate(factor_relation = as.character(fp_faction) <= as.character(sp_faction)) %>% 
    mutate(faction_factor = if_else(factor_relation, 
                                  str_c(fp_faction,' - ', sp_faction),
                                  str_c(sp_faction,' - ', fp_faction)),
           faction_win = if_else(factor_relation,
                                 first_player_wins,
                                 1-first_player_wins)) %>% 
    select(faction_factor, faction_win)

faction_cleaned %>% head()
```

We can now calculate the the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ variables of the Beta distribution. We assume a maximum entropy prior and therefore choose $\alpha_0 = \beta_0 = 1$
```{r}
faction_cleaned <- faction_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(faction_factor) %>% 
  summarise(alpha = 1 + sum(faction_win), 
            beta = 1 + n() - sum(faction_win)) %>% 
  ungroup()

faction_cleaned %>% head()
```
These values can be the new priors for the leader matchups. Let's write a function that adds the parameter values to the faction matchup of a data frame. 

```{r}
add_faction_parameters <- function(df, 
                                   faction_lookup = faction_cleaned, 
                                   statistics = player_game_statistics){
  # Select the relevant game statistics
  game_factions <- player_game_statistics %>% 
      select(game_id, player_id, faction)

  # Add the faction information 
  df <-  df %>% 
    left_join(game_factions, 
              by =c('game_id' = 'game_id','first_player_id'='player_id') ) %>% 
    rename(fp_faction = faction) %>% 
    left_join(game_factions, 
              by =c('game_id' = 'game_id','second_player_id'='player_id') ) %>% 
    rename(sp_faction = faction)
  

  
  df <- df %>% 
    mutate(faction_relation = as.character(fp_faction) <= as.character(sp_faction),
          faction_factor = if_else(faction_relation, 
                                      str_c(fp_faction,' - ', sp_faction),
                                      str_c(sp_faction,' - ', fp_faction))) %>% 
    left_join(faction_lookup, on ='faction_factor') %>% 
    mutate(faction_alpha = if_else(faction_relation, alpha, beta),
           faction_beta = if_else(faction_relation, beta, alpha)) %>% 
    # Set default values
    mutate(faction_alpha = if_else(is.na(faction_alpha), 1, faction_alpha),
           faction_beta = if_else(is.na(faction_beta), 1, faction_beta)) %>% 
    select(-c(alpha,beta,fp_faction, sp_faction, faction_relation, faction_factor ))
  return(df)
}
```

Rather than adding the leaders as a perturbation to the expectations induced by the faction order, we can take this order as an independent factor. This is a Naive Bayes classifier approach, as the features are assumed to be independent, though they are not. Perhaps the final model will be able to adjust the weighting and consider interactions between the components.

```{r}
game_factions <- player_game_statistics %>% 
    select(game_id, player_id, leader)

leader_cleaned <- train_set %>% 
  left_join(game_factions, 
              by =c('game_id' = 'game_id','first_player_id'='player_id') ) %>% 
  rename(fp_leader = leader) %>% 
  left_join(game_factions, 
            by =c('game_id' = 'game_id','second_player_id'='player_id') ) %>% 
  rename(sp_leader = leader) %>% 
  mutate(leader_relation = as.character(fp_leader) <= as.character(sp_leader),
         leader_factor = if_else(leader_relation, 
                                      str_c(fp_leader,' - ', sp_leader),
                                      str_c(sp_leader,' - ', fp_leader)),
         leader_win = if_else(leader_relation,
                                 first_player_wins,
                                 1-first_player_wins)) %>% 
  group_by(leader_factor) %>% 
  summarise(alpha = 1 + sum(leader_win),
            beta = 1+n()-sum(leader_win)) %>% 
  ungroup()

leader_cleaned %>% head()
```

These factors can also be added to any data set via a function.
```{r}
add_leader_parameters <- function(df, 
                                   leader_lookup = leader_cleaned, 
                                   statistics = player_game_statistics){
  # Select the relevant game statistics
  game_factions <- player_game_statistics %>% 
      select(game_id, player_id, leader)

  # Add the faction information 
  df <-  df %>% 
    left_join(game_factions, 
              by =c('game_id' = 'game_id','first_player_id'='player_id') ) %>% 
    rename(fp_leader = leader) %>% 
    left_join(game_factions, 
              by =c('game_id' = 'game_id','second_player_id'='player_id') ) %>% 
    rename(sp_leader = leader)
  

  
  df <- df %>% 
    mutate(leader_relation = as.character(fp_leader) <= as.character(sp_leader),
          leader_factor = if_else(leader_relation, 
                                      str_c(fp_leader,' - ', sp_leader),
                                      str_c(sp_leader,' - ', fp_leader))) %>% 
    left_join(leader_lookup, on ='leader_factor') %>% 
    mutate(leader_alpha = if_else(leader_relation, alpha, beta),
           leader_beta = if_else(leader_relation, beta, alpha)) %>% 
    # Set default values
    mutate(leader_alpha = if_else(is.na(leader_alpha), 1, leader_alpha),
           leader_beta = if_else(is.na(leader_beta), 1, leader_beta)) %>% 
    select(-c(alpha,beta,fp_leader, sp_leader, leader_relation, leader_factor ))
  return(df)
}
```

Next we do a similar thing for the maps. We group by map and who has the first move on the map. This is simplified, as the way the first player is defined in the data, she always has the first move. It is thus straightforward to aggregate the data
```{r}
map_cleaned <- two_player_games %>% 
  left_join(game_info %>% select(game_id, map), by = c('game_id')) %>% 
  group_by(map) %>% 
  summarise(alpha = 1+sum(first_player_wins, na.rm = T),
            beta = 1+n()-sum(first_player_wins, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ungroup()

map_cleaned %>% head()
```

A function that adds this information
```{r}
add_map_parameters <- function(df, 
                                   map_lookup = map_cleaned, 
                                   statistics = game_info){


  # Add the faction information 
  df <-  df %>% 
    left_join(statistics %>% select(game_id, map), by = c('game_id')) 
  
  print(colnames(df))
  
  df <- df %>% 
    left_join(map_lookup, by =c('map'))%>%
    mutate(map_alpha = alpha,
           map_beta = beta) %>%
    # Set default values
    mutate(map_alpha = if_else(is.na(map_alpha), 1, map_alpha),
           map_beta = if_else(is.na(map_beta), 1, map_beta)) %>%
    select(-c(alpha,beta ))
  return(df)
}
```

Additionally we want to add the elo difference as a feature
```{r}
add_elo_diff <- function(df, game_info_tbl = game_info, elo_tbl = elos){
  
  # Calculate the Median of all players as a default choice
  median_elo <- elo_tbl %>% summarise(median_elo = median(elo)) %>% pull()
  
  # Create defaults by setting a very early date. This is the easiest to prevent 
  #  Double counting
  default_elos <- df %>% 
       select(first_player_id, second_player_id) %>% 
       gather(key = player_position, value = player_id) %>% 
       select(player_id) %>% 
       distinct() %>% 
       mutate(player_id = factor(player_id),
              elo = median_elo,
              date = ymd_hms('1900-01-01 01:01:01'))

  all_elos <- elos %>% 
    group_by(player_id, date) %>% 
    # Occasionally the same player has two elos for the same instance in time
    # This prevents that
    summarise(elo = median(elo)) %>% 
    union_all(default_elos) %>% 
    ungroup()

  df_with_features <- df %>%
    left_join(game_info_tbl %>% select(game_id, date) , by = c('game_id')) %>%
    left_join(all_elos %>% rename(elo_date = date), by = c('first_player_id'='player_id')) %>%
    group_by(game_id, first_player_id)%>%
    # Select for the latest Ranking
    filter(elo_date < date) %>%
    filter(elo_date == max(elo_date)) %>%
    rename(fp_elo = elo) %>%
    select(-elo_date) %>%
    left_join(all_elos %>% rename(elo_date = date), by = c('second_player_id'='player_id')) %>%
    group_by(game_id, second_player_id) %>%
    # Select for the latest Ranking
    filter(elo_date < date) %>%
    filter(elo_date == max(elo_date)) %>%
    rename(sp_elo = elo) %>%
    select(-elo_date)  %>%
    mutate(elo_diff = fp_elo - sp_elo,
           elo_diff = if_else(is.na(elo_diff), 0.0, elo_diff)) %>%
    select(-c(date, fp_elo, sp_elo)) %>% 
    ungroup()
  return(df_with_features)
}
```
This function looks for the latest elo numbers before the game. This way it is made certain that the outcome of the game has not have an influence on the elo number, and therefore constitutes as feature creep. If no elo number for at least one of the players is found, the difference is set to zero. It might be more sensible to instead substitute a median value for the missing players. 
All the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ values are hard for a machine learning algorithm to learn. One way to help might be to transform the parameters into an average of the expected value for each feature; map, faction or leader; which is indexed by $i$
$$ \mu_i = \frac{\alpha_i}{\alpha_i + \beta_i}.$$
Intuitively we would like to give an apriori higher weight to features with a larger sum $\alpha + \beta$, as for these situations there is more data. For each of the features and each of the observed cases we can locally weight the features with $\omega_i$,

$$\omega_i = \frac{\alpha_i + \beta_i}{\sum_j (\alpha_j+\beta_j)}$$
This can be combined into a function
```{r}
prepare_data <- function(df){
  df <- add_map_parameters(df)
  df <- add_faction_parameters(df)
  df <- add_leader_parameters(df)
  
  df <- df %>% 
          mutate(leader_mu = leader_alpha/(leader_alpha+leader_beta),
                 faction_mu = faction_alpha/(faction_alpha+faction_beta),
                 map_mu = map_alpha/(map_alpha + map_beta),
                 leader_evid = leader_alpha + leader_beta,
                 faction_evid = faction_alpha + faction_beta,
                 map_evid = map_alpha + map_beta,
                 sum_evid = leader_evid + faction_evid + map_evid,
                 leader_evid = leader_evid/sum_evid,
                 faction_evid = faction_evid/sum_evid,
                 map_evid = map_evid/sum_evid)
  

  
  df <- add_elo_diff(df)
  

  
  df <- df %>% 
          select(game_id, leader_mu, leader_evid, faction_mu, faction_evid,
                 map_mu, map_evid, elo_diff)
  return(df)
}
```

```{r, warning = F}
train_set %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  prepare_data()
```


### Training the Model

A very simple model could be the averaged expectated values of the categorical inferences.
```{r, warning = F, message=F}
train_features <- train_set %>% 
                prepare_data() %>% 
                mutate(prediction = leader_mu*leader_evid + faction_mu*faction_evid + map_mu *  map_evid) %>% 
                inner_join(train_set %>% select(game_id, first_player_wins) , by = c('game_id'))
```

```{r}
auc(train_set$first_player_wins, train_features$prediction )
```

It seems that the pure aggregated feature is not that predictive.
A simple model on the elo_diff might be better.

```{r}
elo_model <- train(factor(first_player_wins)~elo_diff, 
                   method = 'glm', 
                   family = 'binomial',
                   data = train_features)
```
Let us see how predictions work on an unseen test set.
```{r, message = F}
test_features <- test_set %>% 
                    prepare_data()
test_features$prediction <- predict(elo_model, newdata = test_features, type = 'prob')[,2]
```
```{r}
auc(test_set$first_player_wins, test_features$prediction)
```
The elo diff is much more predictive on unseen data! If we combine these, we might be able to get stronger predictive performance.
